  abstract  = {Agile methods have proven their value to accelerate delivery of high quality software products and services to customers. End-users have become used to regular updates that fix bugs and provide new features and for software products, short time-to-market has become an important business driver. In order to remain competitive, more and more companies imple- ment agile methods and their practices also for software-intense, large products, such as cars, telecommunication infrastructure, and embedded systems. Development of such system usually relies on plan-driven, stage-gate processes and is subject to safety and regulative concerns. Consequently, requirements engineering involves upfront and detailed analysis, which can be at odds with agile (software) development. In this paper, we present results from a multiple case study with two car manufacturers, a telecommunications company, and a technology company that are on the journey to introduce organization wide continuous integration and continuous delivery to customers. Based on 20 qualitative interviews, 5 focus groups, and 2 cross-company workshops, we discuss possible scopes of agile methods within system development, the consequences this has on the role of requirements, and the challenges that arise from the interplay of requirements engineering and agile methods in large-scale system development. These relate in particular to communicating and managing knowledge about a) customer value and b) the system under development. We argue that better alignment of a holistic requirements model with agile development practices promises rich gains in development speed, flexibility, and overall quality of software and systems.},

  abstract = {[Context & motivation] For market-driven software product developing organizations operating on a competitive open market, it is important to plan the product’s releases so that they can reach the market as early as possible with a competitive level of quality compared to its competitors’ products. Hence, quality requirements can be seen as a key competitive advantage. The QUPER model was developed with the aim to support high-level decision-making in release planning of quality requirements. [Question/problem] As a follow up on previous studies on QUPER, this study investigates: What are practitioners’ views on the utilities of QUPER extended with guidelines including domain-specific examples? [Principal ideas/results] In the presented case study, a set of detailed guidelines of how to apply QUPER in practice, including how to handle cost dependencies between quality requirements, was evaluated at a case company in the mobile handset domain with 24 professionals using real quality requirements. [Contribution] The results point to the importance of having concrete guidelines combined with instructive examples from real practice, while it is not always obvious for a practitioner to transfer cost-dependency examples into the domains that are different from the example domain. The transferability of guidelines and examples to support methodology adoption is an interesting issue for further research.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Agile manifesto focuses on the delivery of valuable software. In Lean, the principles emphasise value, where every activity that does not add value is seen as waste. Despite the strong focus on value, and that the primary critical success factor for software intensive product development lies in the value domain, no empirical study has investigated specifically what value is. This paper presents an empirical study that investigates how value is interpreted and prioritised, and how value is assured and measured. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 23 participants from 14 agile software development organisations. The contribution of this study is fourfold. First, it examines how value is perceived amongst agile software development organisations. Second, it compares the perceptions and priorities of the perceived values by domains and roles. Third, it includes an examination of what practices are used to achieve value in industry, and what hinders the achievement of value. Fourth, it characterises what measurements are used to assure, and evaluate value-creation activities. },

  abstract  = {Agile development practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, promise value through shorter time to market and increased flexibility. 
While these practices have been widely adopted in small-scale, system development, they have shown to be challenging to adopt in large-scale, system development. 
This is often due to a distance between customer and developer in large scale systems, and the need to break down value from the whole system into manageable parts. 
The notion of value is fundamental for agile methods, especially for practices such as continuous delivery to the customer. 
However, how value should be handled in development practices is not clearly understood. In this paper, we investigate how the notion of adding value in every sprint has been perceived in a large-scale system development. 
Based on an exploratory qualitative case study, the outcome shows that it is perceived beneficial by practitioners although it comes at a price and challenges exist.},
